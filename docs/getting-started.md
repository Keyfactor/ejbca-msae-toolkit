   Examples
   .\toolkit.ps1 acctcreate
   .\toolkit.ps1 validate -configfile .\tests\testing.conf -noninteractive
    ```

1. Run a specific tool using one of the positional parameters with all console prompts
    ```pwsh
    .\toolkit.ps1 acctcreate
    ```

## Configuration File

A configuration file is provided to allow the prepopulate of parameter values. This reduces the number of prompts that may appear asking for values when a tool is selected. It is recommended to update this configuration file when an available variable defined in the file has a known value.

* Leave empty configurations commented out if they do not have a value

```pwsh
.\toolkit.ps1 acctcreate -configfile "prod.conf"
```

# Logging

* All actions are written to a 'main.log' file located in the toolkit root directory 
* The log appends new entries to the Tool Kit and does not overwrite. If you wish to overwrite, you will need to delete the log file before each run. **Be careful as this might erase essential information to a support case**.
* Configuration different log levels include INFO and DEBUG.

# Under Development
## Configuration Wizard

This will allow the user to completely deploy EJBCA MSAE in their enterprise environment with the MSAE Tool Kit. There might be limitations based on existing enterprise Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC).
